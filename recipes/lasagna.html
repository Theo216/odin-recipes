            <li>200g package of lasagna noodles.</li>
            <li>500g small-curd cottage cheese.</li>
            <li>three quarter cup of grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>3 large eggs.</li>

            <li>1 quarter teaspoon ground black pepper.</li>
            <li>200g shredded mozzarella cheese.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Cooking instructions:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat;
                cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar.
                Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally for 30 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>While sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally
                until tender yet firm to the bit, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 190 degrees C.</li>
            <li>
                Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.
            </li>
            <li>Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to coat it;
                Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover. Layer with half of the cheese mixture, half of the remaining sauce, and half of the mozzarella cheese;
                Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella, then cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.
            </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated over for 30 to 40 minutes;
                Then, remove the foil and bake until the cheese is golden brown, approximately 5 to 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
